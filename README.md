# PRODIGY_GA_03
ðŸ§  Markov Chain Text Generator
A simple Python project that generates text using a Markov Chain model. This implementation uses n-grams (default: trigrams) to build a statistical model of word sequences and generate new text from it.

FEATURES:-
1. Customizable n-gram size (e.g., bigram, trigram)

2. Randomized and natural-sounding text generation

3. Clean and minimal implementation using Python standard libraries

HOW IT WORKS:-
1. The model is trained on input text by breaking it into word sequences (n words at a time).

2. It stores possible next words for each sequence.

3. Text is generated by randomly picking a next word based on the current sequence.

TOOLS USED:-
1. Python 3

2. re for tokenization

3. collections.defaultdict for model storage
